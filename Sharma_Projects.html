                    <h3>August-September 2017</h3>
                    <p> The goal of our scratch project was to make a game that would switch from backdrop to backdrop.
                    The character was a ball and the at the end of every level there was an arrow -that would cause the 
                    backdrop to change. Along the levels there were little orange platforms for your character to rest on.
                    Since there were an infinite amount of levels we wanted to see the amount of levels passed, but sadly we 
                    could not create a level counter. This project required skills such as teamwork. If you wish to see the

                    <h3>October - November 2017</h3>
                    <p> The objective of our MIT App Inventor project was to make a game in which you are a rocket and have to
                    shoot the saucer down. You could control the rocket by moving it side to side while it shoots bullets. The saucer
                    would move randomly move across the screen while you try to shoot bullets at it. You could play the game as long as 
                    you wished and the amount of points would be tracked. This project skills like teamwork and patience. Overall
                    it was a fun and amusing project.
